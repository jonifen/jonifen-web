## Sluggy performance (CPU capped)

This morning, I noticed that my Dell XPS 15 9530 felt a little sluggish, so did some investigation and found the CPU clock had capped at a lower speed. I did a full reboot of Windows 10, and luckily this was sufficient to shake things back into life. But a quick read online suggested that some people aren't quite as lucky in this situation.

So if a reboot doesn't resolve the issue, what next?

You'd need to remove the bottom plate on the laptop (My XPS 15 9530 has T6 torx screws, but some newer models I believe have T5), identify where the battery plugs into the motherboard and disconnect it. At this point, it should be sufficient to wait about 20-30 seconds and then reconnect, replace the bottom plate and power back up, but some people have reported holding the power button for 10 seconds or so while the battery is disconnected helped them.

If anyone else out there is having problems, I hope the above helps. And if anyone found alternative solutions, please let me know on Twitter and I'll update this post, giving you credit of course!
