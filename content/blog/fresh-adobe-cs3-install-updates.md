We've not been able to upgrade our Creative Suite version for a few years now, so we're still on CS3. Unfortunately, after installing an SSD in the desktop yesterday, I'm now having to reinstall it with CS3 from the discs. Everything seemed fine until I tried to run an update, at which point it complained with the following message:

```
There are no updates available at this time.
Please note that some updates for the following products cannot be determined at this time: Adobe Updater
```

I thought it a bit odd as Photoshop has updated in the past following an install, so I couldn't understand what was wrong.

So a quick peek on the Internet and I came across this link on the [Adobe Community Forum](http://forums.adobe.com/thread/941381).

It seems all I have to do is set the system clock back to before 1st June 2011 and re-run the updater and all will work fine.

Funnily enough, it did work fine. So then Adobe... who decided to hard code a date for the end of updates!?
