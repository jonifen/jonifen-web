I've recently reviewed some of my blog content and found that some of it is advising of a way to do things in a way that I would no longer suggest. This article in particular focused around using Browserify and also installing npm packages globally; neither of which I've used/done for a long time.

I did write a "revisited" post a few years after this one, which is much more relevant and you can view that here: [React JS Revisited](/blog/react-js-revisited).

_**Why haven't I installed packages globally for a long time?** It is recommended to keep packages installed on a project basis to ensure that different computers don't end up on different versions. As with everything, there are exceptions, such as `windows-build-tools`._
