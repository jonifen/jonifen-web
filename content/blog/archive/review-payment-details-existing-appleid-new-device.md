My daughter has this week got a new iPhone 5C and has been trying to download apps onto it. However, when she logs into her Apple ID on the 5C, she's prompted to review her payment details. In the list that appears, there is no "None" option available, and she doesn't want to enter her card details (for which I don't blame her - I haven't entered mine on my Apple ID either!)

She logged into her Apple ID through iTunes on the PC and it again asked to review the details. On doing this, the "None" option is there to select! Followed the steps and clicked to save and all is working fine now. Just had to re-log into the Apple ID on the phone but apps are downloading successfully. Problem solved!

**Update (09/02/2015):** At the weekend, I set up a new iPad for my mother in law with a new Apple account. They now provide a "None" option for payment method, which is a welcomed change! Thanks Apple :)
