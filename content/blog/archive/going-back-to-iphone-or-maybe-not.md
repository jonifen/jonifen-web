My 'love affair' (if you could ever call it that) with Android has always been a little rocky (as mentioned <a href="mcafee-mobile-security.md">back in June</a>) but I'm now ready to go back to an iPhone.
Being a Dad, this time of year is never exactly the right time to blow out big money on a new phone for myself so that'll have to wait for the new year. But I've got hold of my daughter's old iPhone 5c to use in the meantime.

Great! Except it's pink.

Now I don't have a problem with pink shirts etc. but a pink phone I'm just not sure about... Not that it's actually a problem, as it doesn't even work :(

So as always, [Google is my friend](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Google+is+your+friend) so off I trawl through numerous YouTube videos showing the world of soldering stuff (as if!), I try the recommended steps:

* Plug into the mains for a while using a genuine cable &amp; plug (No luck)
* Plug into the PC with iTunes loaded (I had to install yet another iTunes update first though... grr) (No luck)
* Tried the Power &amp; Home button "trick" as recommended in numerous places for about 30 seconds (No luck)

So I ended up on the Apple site. Anything to avoid a Genius Bar visit at the Trafford Centre at Christmas time! Please... anything... Ah, a "live help" option. Not usually a fan of these, but I'll give it a go.

Given the intelligence and personality behind Siri, I'm still unsure if it's a real person you get to talk to, but Brittany was very helpful and polite but unfortunately it looks like I'll end up at the Genius Bar for this one. Not a big deal, but it just means I'll have to stick out the LG for a little while longer.
