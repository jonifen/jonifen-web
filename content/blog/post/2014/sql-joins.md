I came across this diagram on Twitter a few weeks ago. I saved a copy intending to post it to my site (mainly for future reference) but since then I've forgotten who actually posted it on Twitter. As such, I can't give them a mention. If it was you, get in touch on Twitter and I'll update this post with your details :)
