OK, so I'm not alone here. I finally decided on an XPS 15 and ordered it 10 days ago now. After a couple of days, the Dell website showed the order as shipped and I could track it through their agent Walsh Western (a.k.a. Syncreon). I'm now sat here on the evening before my expected ETA date and it still hasn't reached the UK. The last update is the common "DEPARTED MANU.FACILITY" which appears to be in China. Apparently this is normal in most cases and it might still turn up tomorrow, but how much should I believe it?

I'd have expected a company the size of Dell to have a delivery process held in much higher regard. Rumour on the 'net is that Dell ship in bulk to the UK (expected given the expense of shipping items piece-meal), but why can't they just be upfront about it?

It *should* come tomorrow, but we'll see so watch this space!



**Edit (17/06):** So it didn't arrive, but then again I'm not surprised. The status page at Syncreon hasn't updated all day, so I called them and got told that they haven't been given the package from Dell yet. Once they get it, as it's only 1 box, the delivery process should be quick. Still doesn't explain how the laptop was "Shipped" (Dell's language, not mine) on the 10th and we're now on the 17th and the courier still doesn't have it.

 

**Edit #2 (17/06):** After digging on Dell's website, I notice they've issued a Service Tag for my laptop, and that shows the shipped date of the 10/06. Which means my 12 month warranty is ticking away and it's not even been picked up by the courier! Think I'll need to have words with Dell on this one!
