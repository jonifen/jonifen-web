My son recently bought an Acer A3-A10 tablet with some money he had saved. It's a great tablet for the £135 it cost at Argos and even sweeter with the £10 voucher with which he was able to get a Google Play voucher :)
Anyway, to the point of this post. When I play Minecraft Pocket Edition against him, I found the mobs were invisible and I couldn't even hear any creepers or spiders, I just got exploded or bit by them silently. I thought this was a little odd, and after searching for information at the time, I was unable to find anything about it. Until now.

Enter "EdGe7x" on the [Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/minecraft-pocket-edition-support/2180436-invisible-monsters-pocket-edition-multiplayer-with) who has helped someone with a similar issue (across different iOS versions rather than Android to iOS) who said to make sure that the difficulty level is set the same on both host and client games. We gave it a go and it's working a treat now!

We also tested what would happen if the host was on peaceful, but the client not... there are no mobs on either device. Seems like a bit of a bug in the game as surely the host should dictate all these options? Seems a common problem that people are aware of though, it's just hard to find!
