**Wow!**

I've just tried editing a markdown file in Visual Studio and they have a cracking auto-preview on the right hand side of the page!
Granted, you have to save the file to get the preview to update, but hey, I can live with that! This will make things a lot easier given that I'm currently keeping my content markdown stored in a TFS repository.
Seems daft to make a post so small, but I was impressed.
