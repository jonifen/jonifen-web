I ended up taking the plunge and ordering a Raspberry Pi 2 which arrived today.
But, I thought I had another MicroSD card which was Class 6 or 10, but unfortunately not... so I've given it a quick whirl with the Class 4 MicroSD that came with my Pi B (with adapter) and it seems to work quite well.
I'm amazed by how responsive it is with MinecraftPi running and how it allows me to open Python files without hanging around. I can definitely see my son trying to nab this off me! :)

But... the intention for this is to present video streams (Sky Go etc.) onto a TV so if it works for that, then I'll have to buy another!

**Edit 25/03/15:** A pair of 16Gb Class 10 MicroSD cards arrived today, so I'm installing Raspbian onto it now. I suppose the spare will be commandeered by my son if he ends up with a Pi2 aswell. It's installing quicker anyway, so hopefully that's a good sign.
