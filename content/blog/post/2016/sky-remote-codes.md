Sky provide a remote code tool on their website, but it can hardly be called accurate. It's happened on a few occasions now, that I spend some time trying different codes that the tool provides for a TV, only to be left empty-handed (well, not entirely... I actually end up with my hands full... one remote in each hand in fact.)

So I've decided to create a post on here, which undoubtedly Google will spider at some point, that I'll keep updated with every future encounter that Sky's website doesn't help with.

So, here goes!

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Brand/Model</td>
      <td>Sky's Codes</td>
      <td>Working Code</td>
      <td>Comments</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>JVC LT-42C550</td>
      <td>0681/1846/1191</td>
      <td>3830</td>
      <td>
        Must be a Rev.10 remote<br />
        Thanks to Susan101 on the [Sky Help Forum](http://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Remotes-accessories/Anyone-have-a-Sky-remote-code-for-JVC-LT-40C540/td-p/2209563)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Hope this post helps some people out :)
