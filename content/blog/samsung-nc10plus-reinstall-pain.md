I've had to do a restore on a Samsung NC10+ which is an Atom N450 based netbook from a few years back. But for some reason, the recovery stuff just won't work and I've had to do a clean install of Windows. And the Samsung support website... well, it's not much support at all. In fact, I don't think they even remember releasing the NC10+. Only the original NC10.

Luckily, Windows 7 installs drivers for most things, but missing the two important ones... Video and Wireless. So after a long hunt, I've found the needed drivers to be:

### Wireless
The wireless adapter is the Broadcom BC4313. It has Hardware Ids of:

	PCI\VEN_14E4&DEV_4727&SUBSYS_051A185F&REV_01
	PCI\VEN_14E4&DEV_4727&SUBSYS_051A185F
	PCI\VEN_14E4&DEV_4727&CC_028000
	PCI\VEN_14E4&DEV_4727&CC_0280

Lenovo have drivers for it: http://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/downloads/ds008111

### Video
The video adapter is the Intel GMA 3150. I found a driver for Windows 7 32-bit on the Intel website (which I could get to once the wireless was up and running!)

### Bluetooth
Bluetooth is Broadcom BCM2070 Bluetooth 3.0 + HS USB Device. Windows 7 installs it using the Microsoft driver by default.

### Chipset
The main chipset is Intel's NM10. Windows appears to install pretty much everything that is needed. But I installed the Intel INF chipset utility for the NM10 chipset anyway to be on the safe side.

This has probably been my most painful reinstall job of all time... and I've reinstalled a lot of PCs over the years! Just when I thought all was going well, Windows Update decided to play up too. Argh!
