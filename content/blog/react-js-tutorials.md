I've created a few pages on here which are now growing into a bit of a tutorial, so thought I'd collate the links into one post (and append links to any new related posts in the future) so it's easier to follow.

So to start off, I'll rewind back to November 2015, when I created my [Getting Started with React.js](/blog/post/2015/getting-started-with-reactjs/) post. This was using JSX and ES5, along with Browserify to "compile" the code to "Vanilla JS" which the web browsers support. Fast forward now back to this year (2017), and I've created an update post to that, along with a few subsequent posts that take the journey a few steps further.

 * [React.js Revisited](/blog/post/2017/react-js-revisited/)
 * [React.js Continued... Components!](/blog/post/2017/react-js-continued-components/)
 * [React.js Continued... State!](/blog/post/2017/react-js-state/)

I will be expanding on these posts in the coming weeks, so watch this space!
