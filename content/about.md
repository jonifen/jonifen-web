I'm a Software Developer using C#, JavaScript (including React and Redux). As penance for a past life, I have a lot of experience with VB6 too :)

Outside of work, I'm a Dad of 4. I'm married to [Di](http://dicain.co.uk).

I enjoy cycling, and am quite happy to tinker with one to get it working great (except when it's fixing a puncture in the rain!). I used to commute by bike to work, but since changing jobs in 2018, I've found the bus much easier so I'm yet to get on the bike for the commute.

I'm pretty interested in cars too, but unlike with the bikes, I'm much too scared to tinker with them in case things go wrong :)

I try to help out on StackOverflow when I get some free time which is pretty difficult for C# questions, as nobody's quicker at responding than Jon Skeet ;)

Otherwise, I like to play video games. Nowadays, this is mainly on the PS4 and usually on the latest FIFA or Gran Turismo, although I did have a misspent youth on Quake 2, 3, Unreal Tournament and CounterStrike.
