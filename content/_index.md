I'm a Software Developer using C#, JavaScript (including React and Redux). As penance for a past life, I have a lot of experience of VB6 too :)

Outside of work, I'm a Dad of 4. I'm married to [Di](http://dicain.co.uk).

I have an interest in cars (although mine has given me a few grey hairs), but as much as I'd love to, I'm scared to tinker with them too much in case things go wrong!

I'm also pretty mad on bicycles... and I'm quite happy tinkering with a bike to get it working great. I used to commute to work by bike, but since changing jobs last year, I've been on the bus which (dare I say it?) has been mostly alright, so I'm yet to get on the bike for the commute.


I try to help out on StackOverflow when I get some free time which is pretty difficult for C# questions, as nobody's quicker at responding than Jon Skeet ;)

Otherwise, I like to play video games. Nowadays, this is mainly on the PS4, although I did have a misspent youth on Quake 2, 3, Unreal Tournament and CounterStrike.
